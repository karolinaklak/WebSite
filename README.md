# WebSite
An inspired website in order to share my contacts, and my projects.
A lot of projects are actually in private mode.

# My Current Situation
Currently working on C# .Net projects, from ordinary console apps, to more technical stuff such as apps optimised with MVC, TDD coding way, using JS techs ( Angular, React), with Docker, or even some deployment with Azure. 
It aims on having knowledge in devops.
